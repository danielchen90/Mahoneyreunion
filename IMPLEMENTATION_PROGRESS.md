## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### **Step 1: Database Setup** ⚠️ **REQUIRED BEFORE CONTINUING**
You need to run the SQL schema in Neon console:
1. Open `DATABASE_SCHEMA_ALL_PHASES.sql`
2. Copy all contents
3. Run in Neon SQL Editor
4. Verify tables created

### **Step 2: Create Super Admin**
After database is set up:
```bash
node scripts/create-super-admin.js
```

### **Step 3: Continue Implementation**
Once database is ready, I'll continue with:
1. Update admin dashboard with Users tab
2. Create middleware for route protection
3. Test Phase 2 completely
4. Move to Phase 4 (Task Management)
5. Finally Phase 3 (File Storage)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### **Authentication:**
- Using JWT with jose library (modern, secure)
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- 24-hour token expiry
- Account locking after 5 failed attempts (30 min lockout)

### **Password Security:**
- bcrypt with salt rounds = 10
- Minimum 8 characters
- Requires uppercase, lowercase, and number

### **Permissions:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- 4 role levels with hierarchy
- 25+ granular permissions
- Tab-level access control

### **Database:**
- PostgreSQL (Neon)
- UUID primary keys
- Timestamps with timezone
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Comprehensive indexes

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Before Testing:**
1. ✅ NPM packages installed
2. ⏳ **Database tables must be created** (run SQL schema)
3. ⏳ **Super admin must be created** (run script)
4. ⏳ Environment variables must be set:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (already set)
   - `JWT_SECRET` (optional, has default)

### **Security Considerations:**
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens are HTTP-only cookies
- Permission checks on all endpoints
- Role hierarchy prevents privilege escalation
- Account locking prevents brute force

### **Testing Checklist (After Database Setup):**
- [ ] Create super admin user
- [ ] Log in with super admin
- [ ] Create new users with different roles
- [ ] Test permission restrictions
- [ ] Test user CRUD operations
- [ ] Test account locking (5 failed attempts)
- [ ] Test password validation
- [ ] Test email validation
