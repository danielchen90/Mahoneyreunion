# 🚀 SETUP DATABASE - DO THIS NOW!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Run This SQL Before Continuing

Before I can continue with the implementation, you need to create all the database tables.

---

## **📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Open Neon Console**
1. Go to: **https://console.neon.tech**
2. Log in to your account
3. Select your project

### **Step 2: Open SQL Editor**
1. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. You'll see a text area for SQL queries

### **Step 3: Run the Complete Schema**
1. Open the file: **`DATABASE_SCHEMA_ALL_PHASES.sql`**
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents
3. Paste into the Neon SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

### **Step 4: Verify Success**
You should see success messages for:
- ✅ 13 tables created
- ✅ 30+ indexes created
- ✅ 1 super admin user created

---

## **📊 WHAT GETS CREATED:**

### **Phase 1 Tables:**
- `contact_submissions` - Contact form submissions

### **Phase 2 Tables:**
- `admin_users` - Admin user accounts
- `admin_activity_logs` - Activity tracking
- `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset functionality

### **Phase 3 Tables:**
- `folders` - File organization
- `files` - File metadata and storage

### **Phase 4 Tables:**
- `tasks` - Task management
- `task_comments` - Task discussions
- `task_attachments` - File attachments for tasks
- `meeting_notes` - Meeting documentation
- `meeting_tasks` - Link tasks to meetings

---

## **🔐 DEFAULT SUPER ADMIN USER:**

**Email:** admin@mahoneyfamily.com  
**Password:** mahoney2026  
**Role:** Super Admin

**Note:** The password will be properly hashed when you first log in through the new system.

---

## **✅ VERIFICATION:**

After running the SQL, verify with these queries:

```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Should show 13 tables:
-- admin_activity_logs
-- admin_users
-- contact_submissions
-- files
-- folders
-- meeting_notes
-- meeting_tasks
-- password_reset_tokens
-- task_attachments
-- task_comments
-- tasks
```

---

## **⏱️ TIME REQUIRED:**

- Copy SQL: 10 seconds
- Run SQL: 5 seconds
- Verify: 5 seconds

**Total: ~20 seconds**

---

## **🚨 IMPORTANT:**

**I cannot continue with the implementation until these tables are created!**

The code I'm about to write depends on these database tables existing.

---

## **✅ ONCE COMPLETE:**

Let me know when you've:
1. ✅ Run the SQL in Neon console
2. ✅ Verified tables were created
3. ✅ No errors occurred

Then I'll continue with:
- Installing NPM packages
- Creating authentication system
- Building all the features

---

**Please run the SQL now and let me know when it's done!** 🚀
