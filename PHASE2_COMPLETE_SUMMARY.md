## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Default Credentials:**
- **Email:** admin@mahoneyfamily.com
- **Password:** mahoney2026
- ⚠️ **Change this password after first login!**

### **Security Considerations:**
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens are HTTP-only cookies (cannot be accessed by JavaScript)
- Account locking prevents brute force attacks
- Permission checks on all endpoints
- Role hierarchy prevents privilege escalation

### **Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Already set (Neon connection)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Optional (has secure default)
- Can be generated with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### **Database Tables:**
- `admin_users` - User accounts
- `admin_activity_logs` - Activity tracking (for future use)
- `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset (for future use)
