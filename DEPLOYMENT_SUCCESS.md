## ⚠️ **TEMPORARILY DISABLED (For Initial Deployment)**

### **Admin Features (Phases 2-4):**
- ❌ Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- ❌ User Management
- ❌ Task Management
- ❌ Meeting Notes
- ❌ File Storage
- ❌ Admin API Routes (`/api/admin/*`, `/api/auth/*`)

**Why Disabled:**
- These features require environment variables (JWT_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY credentials)
- Disabling them allowed us to deploy the main website immediately
- They can be re-enabled later once API keys are configured

**How to Re-enable:**
1. Set up environment variables in Vercel
2. Rename folders back:
   - `app/api/_admin_disabled` → `app/api/admin`
   - `app/api/_auth_disabled` → `app/api/auth`
   - `app/_admin_disabled` → `app/admin`
3. Restore middleware functionality
4. Redeploy

---

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS CHANGED FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **1. Admin Routes Disabled:**
```bash
# Renamed folders to exclude from build
app/api/admin → app/api/_admin_disabled
app/api/auth → app/api/_auth_disabled
app/admin → app/_admin_disabled
```

### **2. Middleware Simplified:**
```typescript
// middleware.ts - Now just passes all requests through
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

### **3. Email Notifications Disabled:**
```typescript
// app/api/contact/submit/route.ts
// Commented out sendContactFormNotification()
// Contact forms still save to database
```
