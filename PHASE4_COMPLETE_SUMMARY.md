## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Database Setup** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**
The database tables for Phase 4 are already included in `DATABASE_SCHEMA_ALL_PHASES.sql`. If you've already run the schema, you're good to go!

**Verify tables exist:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('tasks', 'task_comments', 'task_attachments', 'meeting_notes', 'meeting_tasks')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see:
- meeting_notes
- meeting_tasks
- task_attachments
- task_comments
- tasks

### **Step 2: Test Phase 4 Features**

**Test Tasks:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
2. Log in with super admin credentials
3. Click "Tasks" tab
