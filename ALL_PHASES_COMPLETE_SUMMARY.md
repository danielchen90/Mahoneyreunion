5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" to execute
7. Verify all 13 tables were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   ORDER BY table_name;
   ```

### **Step 2: Create Super Admin** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**

2. Run: `node scripts/create-super-admin.js`
3. Default credentials will be created:
   - Email: admin@mahoneyfamily.com
   - Password: mahoney2026
4. You can change these in the script before running
